# Introduction

### Our Motivation:

* Smartphones have become a necessity for people of all ages. However, students are unable to afford any smartphone that they like due to the limited funds they have, as well as the increasingly cost of phones.

* Hence, it is important to know whether a phone is worth its price, allowing students to maximize their satisfaction, and ensure that their money is well spent. 

### Project Goal
* This project aims to maximize students satisfaction with the smartphone that they buy by considering some factors of the phone and predicting the worth of the smartphone before buying, hence giving students the ability to decide whether the smartphone is worth it.
