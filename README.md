Our Motivation:
⋅⋅* Smartphones have become a necessity for people of all ages. However, students are unable to afford any smartphone that they like due to the limited funds they have, as well as the increasingly cost of phones.

⋅⋅* Hence, it is important to know whether a phone is worth its price, allowing students to maximize their satisfaction, and ensure that their money is well spent.
